This code provides banks with significant insights into the actual use of the Banker's Algorithm in real-life situations. Banks may maximize transaction processing, improve system dependability, and maintain strict security requirements by utilizing their capabilities. In the ever-changing banking sector, the Banker's Algorithm remains a reliable and trusted tool.
It enables banks to adapt to the changing demands of their clients while upholding the security and reliability of their systems.


The Banker's Algorithm uses simulations of resource allocation situations to decide if granting a resource request will lead to a safe state. In a safe state, deadlock is prevented and all processes can finally finish their jobs. 

The Banker's Algorithm has two primary components: the Safety Algorithm and the Resource Request Algorithm.

1. The Safety Algorithm assesses the system's safety status by repeatedly verifying if processes can get their maximal resource requirements without triggering a deadlock. If there is a sequence of resource allocations that guarantees safety, the system is considered safe and resource requests can be approved.

2. The Resource Request Algorithm manages resource requests made by processes. The method checks if a process can be given the requested resources without breaking any safety rules when the process asks for resources. If the required resources are present and their distribution ensures system safety, the request is approved; otherwise, the process is compelled to wait until resources become available.
